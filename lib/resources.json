Let's start with Habit 1: Be Proactive.\nHopper: But what does that mean?\nMcFlap: It means you choose how you respond to situations.\nYou can't control what others do, but you can control how you react.\nHopper: So, if kids tease me, I can choose to smile and say, 'I like who I am'?\nMcFlap: Exactly! When you're proactive, you show others that you're strong and confident.\nHopper: I like that feeling!"

Ask yourself, 'What can we do that works for everyone?' \nHopper: Like playing both run and chase and hide-and-seek! If we compromise, everyone gets to have fun. \nMcFlap: That's win-win magic!

People feel cared for when they're heard. \nHopper : Okay? So I first listen to his side then I can share my side of the story? \nMcFlap: Exactly!

        "title": "Hopper Learns to be Proactive",
        "content": "Hopper: What are the 7 habits? How will I use them? \nMc Flap: Don’t worry, I’ll explain all the habits to you but let us start with the 1st habit, “Be Proactive”. \nTo understand what it means to be proactive, it is important to know what it means to be reactive, they are antonyms. Reactive people avoid taking responsibilities of their choice by blaming circumstances, others, or genetics for their errors. They often suffer from a contagious virus, victimitis. Infected people believe that everyone has it in for them and that the world owes them something, which isn’t the case at all. The way Mark Twain put it as is- “Don’t go around saying the world owes you a living.  The world owes you nothing, it was here first.” You can tell instantly if someone is reactive or proactive by listening to their language. Reactive people talk about how helpless they are. Proactive people speak the language of “I can”. \nHopper: Oooh! Now I understand. \nMc Flap: You can understand that even though the situation with your family is difficult, you can control over how you respond to it. You don’t have to let the actions of others determine your mood or your future. Being proactive means taking responsibility for your own actions, thoughts, and emotion. You should focus on the things you can control, such as your feelings and your actions. You can't control how your uncle behaves, but you can choose how you handle your emotions. Instead of letting the fight with your uncle push you into depression, you can choose to handle the situation calmly, talk things out with your uncle and father, and seek peace instead of conflict. So did you get it? \nHopper: Yes! I did, so, I need to take responsibility of my own actions. \nMc Flap: Great!! Let’s move further now."

        "title": "Streamlining Hopper's Mind",
        "content": "Mc Flap: Did you practice the proactivity methods I suggested you last time? How are you feeling about it? \nHopper: Yes, I sure did and am feeling much better and efficient now! \nMc Flap:  Good, now it’s time to learn the 2nd habit “Begin with the End in Mind”. \nHopper: Woah! This sounds interesting. So, what should I learn from this habit? \nMc Flap: It helps you identify the life you want to live, and then set goals and make plans to turn that into a reality. This takes vision and commitment. Let us understand the doors it can unlock in our life.  \nLike, you should think about what you truly want in life beyond the fight over the land.  \nHopper: Is it peace, success, or something else?  \nMc Flap: Yes, It can be any of these. It varies for everyone since all of us have different desires and goals and by focusing on the bigger picture, you can make decisions that align with your true desires.  \nSecond, you can learn to have a control over your emotions. By visualizing the conclusion result of your actions (such as how you want your family relationships to turn out), you can handle situations more calmly and avoid being overwhelmed by temporary emotions. \nBy learning to “Begin with the end in mind,” you can take control of your thoughts and actions, creating a clear path forward, and stop letting temporary emotions or events like the argument between your uncle and father dictate your happiness and life. This is all you need to learn in this habit. So, did you understand it? \nHopper: Yes I now understood the 2nd Habit of LIM. Thanks a lot for helping. I will surely try to implement it as well. My mind feels much more streamlined now."

        "title": "Hopper Learns to Prioritize and Resolve Conflicts",
        "content": "Mc Flap: You have learned 2 habits of LIM. Now it’s time to learn 3rd habit of LIM which is “Put First Things First”.  \nHopper: okay….? \nMc Flap: Habit 3 Put First Things First is about spending your time on what is most important to you to achieve your goals and the future you imagined. It is about having the discipline to live true to your mission statement (the big picture of you and your life) and to your priority. \nHopper: Hmm…... can you explain clearly? \nMc Flap: Sure. Let me tell you about it in detail. \nLet us take the example of your situation only. You need to focus on the things that truly matter to you and your emotional well-being, your relationship with your family, and your mental health. The fight over land and the sadness of losing your grandfather might seem urgent or overwhelming but you need to take control of your emotions and mindset. \nHopper: How can I do that? \nMc Flap: You can practice emotional control here as well. You can also apply this habit by addressing your feelings of depression and sadness. Acknowledging those emotions and seeking support (whether through counseling or talking with family members) can be your top priority, rather than letting the anger and hurt over the family conflict dominate your thoughts and actions. \nYou can also try time management. You can manage your time better and take out time for actions that nurture your mind; and help you get some mental peace and help your way out of depression. Complete all your necessary tasks and activities, make a to-do list for the same and add some time for your mental wellbeing there. Instead of allowing the stressful situation to consume, you could focus on activities that help you regain peace and balance, like exercising, meditating, or doing things you enjoy. \nThat was all it was. \nHopper: Wow! So easy! I have learned 3 habits and now which is the next one, I am excited!!"

        "title": "The Art of Settling Midway, Ensuring Profit for All",
        "content": "Mc Flap: Now we will learn the 4th habit of LIM which is “Think Win-Win”. \nHopper: And what does it mean? \nMc Flap: Think Win-Win means finding a solution where everyone gets benefitted instead of just one person winning. Right now, your dad and uncle are stuck in a ‘Win-Lose’ mindset—each one wants to take all the land, and that’s causing endless fights. But what if they worked together to find a fair solution? \nHopper: That sounds nice, but how do I make that happen? They don’t even listen to each other! \nMc Flap: Good question! Here’s what you can do-  You can get a neutral person to help, maybe a family elder or family friend you can place your bet on for your situation can help them find a fair decision. Sometimes, a fresh perspective can make a big difference! \nHopper: Sure, I have many Uncles and Aunts with whom I can discuss this issue. \nFlap: Take their help to encourage a calm talk.  Via them, you can convey that instead of arguing, they should sit down and discuss things peacefully.  Or if you want to do it single- handedly, maybe you can convince your family members especially you father and uncle by saying some thing along the lines of, ‘Dad, Uncle, I know you both want the land, but can we talk about a way to make things fair for both of you?’  \nTry to find a fair solution instead of fighting over who gets more, they can split the land fairly, sell it and share the money, or even use it together. They just need to see the bigger picture! You can do this by reminding them what matters the most. Fighting over land makes the family unhappy. You can remind them, ‘Grandpa wouldn’t want us to be like this. He would want us to stay united as a family.’ That might help them see the real issue. \nHopper: Wow, I never thought about it that way! Instead of feeling hopeless, I can actually do something to help my family. I’ll categorically try to get them to Think Win-Win! \nMc Flap: That’s the spirit! You’re not just solving a problem—you’re becoming a leader. Let’s make this happen!"

        "title": "Listening to Both Sides",
        "content": "Mc Flap: Now it’s time to understand habit 5 of LIM “Seek First to Understand Then to Be Understood”. \nHopper: What is this habit all about? I am feeling curious. \nMc Flap: I will tell you, have patience. Firstly, Understand your Family’s Perspective, Instead of reacting emotionally, you can try to understand why your father and uncle are arguing. Maybe both have their specific concerns or fears about the land. Next, try to have Empathetic Listening. You can listen to both sides calmly, without immediately judging or taking sides.  \nHopper: So, I have to listen to both the sides. \nMc Flap: Yes, perfect!! You are moving in the right direction, understanding all tit-bits of these habits. You can also Ask Thoughtful Questions. Instead of jumping to conclusions, you can ask, \"What do you think Grandpa wanted?\"  or \"How can we make a fair decision that respects his wishes?” Alongside, Encourage Calm Discussion. You can suggest a family meeting where both sides can speak and feel heard. This helps create a respectful environment. You can also put forward your views in a calm and respectful manner after hearing all sides of the story without showing favour or soft corner towards anyone. Your perspective matters too. \nHopper: You are right! These tips can be really helpful."

I arranged a discussion in my family with help of Avni Aunty. Though there is still some grief within me, I am yet to overcome. \nMc Flap: Marvellous job, I am proud of you and feeling happy that I can be of any help. I am going to teach you the 6th habit which is “Synergize”. \nHopper: What should I learn from this habit? \nMc Flap: Try Not to Take Sides. Instead of supporting one side, you should help both. Promote Respect and Teamwork. You should remind them of their father’s wish for peace and unity. It will result in a Better Outcome. The final agreement will be better than what either of them could have come up with alone — that’s synergy! \nHopper: Oooh! Now I understand the 6th habit."

You need to renew your mind, body and soul. You need some time to rest and re-energise. You need to relax yourself. Firstly, You need to focus on your Physical and Mental Well-Being. You can start exercising, playing outdoor games, and eating healthy to keep your body strong. You can also read books, solve puzzles, and focus on your studies to keep your mind sharp. In addition to these you can talk to your close friends, including me, about your feelings instead of keeping them bottled up. Secondly, Practice Spiritual Renewal. You should spend time in nature, meditating, and renewing yourself and practicing gratitude to find inner peace. And lastly, Balance Your Life like you are its Driver, not the outside scenarios. You should make sure to give time to all aspects of your life—family, friends, hobbies, and self-care. \nHopper: I am getting what you are trying to say, self-care and self-renewal is magnificently important. After understanding all the habits now I am actually feeling quite good. I will positively implement all these habits in my life and also tell my family about these habits. \nMc Flap: Great! You have understood the true essence of all the habits. By following these habits, you will become stronger and can easily handle the stress of your family’s land dispute and can also help them resolve it."
